            <p>This section offers brief observations on the poetic diction of each play. Each entry notes the percentage of prose and/or verse in a given play, as well as the amount of rhyming verse, if significant. It also includes a sampling of contractions and of words that expand to fulfill the demands of the meter. Examples of words that require an unusual stress on either their first or second syllables follow. For example, revenue is pronounced today with a stress on its first syllable but often requires a stress on its second syllable in Shakespeare. We direct readers to the appropriate sections for accents, dialects, foreign languages, Latin, and words that might present unforeseen difficulty.</p>
